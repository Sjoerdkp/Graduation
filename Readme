Here you can find the codes and files that are associated to the graduation research I have performed.

The research question is:
To what extent do EV movements influence the potential of EV-flexibility for providing FCR?

When looking at the codes, four types of scripts can be distinguished:
- The scripts Restructure mobility data, Calculate probabilities of EV movements and Triplengths are used to prepare mobility input data.
- The scripts Prepare electricity demand data and Prepare FCR price data are used to prepare other input data.
- The script Generate mobility behaviour can be used to generate stochastic runs of mobility behaviour of which 200 examples are provided.
- The scripts Deterministic model and Stochastic model contain the models in which the data is used.

When looking at the datafiles, two different types of files can be distinguished:
- The datafiles starting with "Random EV" each contain one run with stochastically generated mobility behaviour. 
- The other datafiles serve as input to the deterministic and stochastic model.

When preparing the mobility data, several steps had to be taken. Therefore the following scripts have been used in the following order:
- Restructure mobility data --> Calculate probabilities of EV movements --> Generate mobility behaviour.
- Also the script Triplength serves as input to the script Generate mobility behaviour.
